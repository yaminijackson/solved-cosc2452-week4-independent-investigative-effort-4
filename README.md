   <td>. This week’s programming task will cover concepts required by Assignment 2. You should aim to get the help of your tutors and make further revisions.<strong>Coding exercise steps (Hint: Need help? Ask your tutor via Canvas→Discussions→”IIE04″): </strong>Follow Canvas→<a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/modules">Modules→Week 4</a> first. It covers while-loops for repeating a indefinite number of times.<strong>a.                   </strong>Make a copy of your IIE03 Eclipse project (GTerm version that takes an entire record using one input) and rename the project to IIE04 or similar, as shown during the week 1 ‘weekly live lecture’. Ensure that your .java file is not PleaseRenameMe.java and it is something relevant to your application (avoid names such as IIE04.java; give it a personality!) but remember to follow class naming conventions (refer to IIE01). You must be able to <strong>show how your work is different to the “student manager” examples</strong> shown in the live lectures, if it can be thought of as being similar.Now modify your program to add input validation (“scenario 2”) loops for all of the values of each record. If one of the values of a record is incorrect, your code should not ask to enter only that value and it should ask to do so indefinitely, until the user enters a valid value. <strong>Are you stuck? Please ask your friendly tutor by creating a post in the relevant IIE forum.</strong><strong>b.                   </strong>For each declaration, condition and code block, add justification comments as required by Assignment 1/2’s specification. This is a skill at which you will get better with experience and it is important to get started. <strong>Are you stuck? Please ask your friendly tutor by creating a post in the relevant IIE forum.</strong><strong>c.                    </strong>Using GTerm’s <a href="https://jupiter.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e58140/GTerm/doc/GTerm.html">addTable and addRowToTable methods</a>, add all of the records to the table as each record is entered.</td>

Make a copy of your IIE04 and name it IIE04C. Now get your program to work using Scanner and System.out to operate exclusively via the console area of Eclipse (IIE04C should not have any mentions of GTerm or JOptionPane). You must  still create tables to mimic the GTerm version. You must only use Scanner’s .nextLine() method to take inputs as Strings first and then covert them to relevant primitive types using the wrapper classes (e.g. Integer.parseInt, etc.). Do not use .nextInt(), .nextDouble(), etc. <strong>Are you stuck? Please ask your friendly tutor by creating a post in the relevant IIE forum.</strong>
